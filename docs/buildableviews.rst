Buildable views
===============

Django's `class-based views <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/>`_  are used to render HTML pages to flat files. Putting all the pieces together is a little tricky at first, particularly if you haven't studied `the Django source code <https://github.com/django/django/tree/master/django/views/generic>`_ or lack experience `working with Python classes <http://www.diveintopython.net/object_oriented_framework/defining_classes.html>`_ in general. But if you figure it out, we think it's worth the trouble.

BuildableTemplateView
---------------------

.. py:class:: BuildableTemplateView(TemplateView, BuildableMixin)

    Renders and builds a simple template as a flat file. Extended from Django's
    generic `TemplateView <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/base/#django.views.generic.base.TemplateView>`_.
    The base class has a number of options not documented here you should consult.

    .. py:attribute:: build_path

        The target location of the built file in the ``BUILD_DIR``.
        ``index.html`` would place it at the built site's root.
        ``foo/index.html`` would place it inside a subdirectory. Required.

    .. py:attribute:: template_name

        The name of the template you would like Django to render. Required.

    .. py:method:: build()

        Writes the rendered template's HTML to a flat file. Only override this if you know what you're doing.

    .. py:attribute:: build_method

        An alias to the ``build`` method used by the :doc:`management commands </managementcommands>`

    **Example myapp/views.py**

    .. code-block:: python

        from bakery.views import BuildableTemplateView

        class ExampleTemplateView(BuildableTemplateView):
            build_path = 'examples/index.html'
            template_name = 'examples.html'


BuildableListView
-----------------

.. class:: BuildableListView(ListView, BuildableMixin)

    Render and builds a page about a list of objects. Extended from Django's
    generic `ListView <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#django.views.generic.list.ListView>`_.
    The base class has a number of options not documented here you should consult.
    Pagination is handled like a django ListView, and templates should be
    designed in the same way.
    When pagination is enabled the default build locations for the first page are: build_folder/build_path and /build_folder/build_page_name/1/build_path, with other pages only built in:
    /build_folder/build_page_name/<page_number>/build_path

    .. attribute:: model

        A Django database model where the list of objects can be drawn
        with a ``Model.objects.all()`` query. Optional. If you want to provide
        a more specific list, define the ``queryset`` attribute instead.

    .. attribute:: queryset

        The list of objects that will be provided to the template. Can be
        any iterable of items, not just a Django queryset. Optional, but
        if this attribute is not defined the ``model`` attribute must be
        defined.

    .. attribute:: build_folder

        The target location of the flat file in the ``BUILD_DIR``.
        Optional. The default is blank,  would place the flat file
        at the site's root. Defining it as ``foo/`` would place
        the flat file inside a subdirectory foo/.

    .. attribute:: build_page_name

        The target location of the flat file in the ``BUILD_DIR``.
        Optional. The default is ``page``,  would place the page file
        in /page/1/<build_path>, /page/2/<build_path>.

    .. attribute:: build_path

        The target location of the flat file in the ``BUILD_DIR``.
        Optional. The default is ``index.html``,  would place the flat file
        at the site's root. Defining it as ``foo/index.html`` would place
        the flat file inside a subdirectory.

    .. attribute:: template_name

        The template you would like Django to render. You need
        to override this if you don't want to rely on the Django ``ListView``
        defaults.

    .. py:attribute:: build_method

        An alias to the ``build_queryset`` method used by the :doc:`management commands </managementcommands>`

    .. py:method:: get_page_build_path()

        Create the path to build each page in pagination
        Defaults to building in:
        <build_folder>/<build_page_name>/<page>/<build_path>
        The current page is held in self.kwargs['page']


    .. py:method:: build_queryset()

        Writes the rendered template's HTML to a flat file. Only override this if you know what you're doing.

    **Example myapp/views.py**

    .. code-block:: python

        from myapp.models import MyModel
        from bakery.views import BuildableListView


        class ExampleListView(BuildableListView):
            model = MyModel
            template_name = 'mymodel_list.html'


        class DifferentExampleListView(BuildableListView):
            build_path = 'mymodel/index.html'
            queryset = MyModel.objects.filter(is_published=True)
            template_name = 'mymodel_list.html'

.. _buildable-detail-view:

BuildableDetailView
-------------------

.. class:: BuildableDetailView(DetailView, BuildableMixin)

    Render and build a "detail" page about an object or a series of pages
    about a list of objects. Extended from Django's generic `DetailView <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#detailview>`_.
    The base class has a number of options not documented here you should consult.

    .. attribute:: model

        A Django database model where the list of objects can be drawn
        with a ``Model.objects.all()`` query. Optional. If you want to provide
        a more specific list, define the ``queryset`` attribute instead.

    .. attribute:: queryset

        The Django model queryset objects are to be looked up from. Optional, but
        if this attribute is not defined the ``model`` attribute must be
        defined.

    .. attribute:: template_name

        The name of the template you would like Django to render. You need
        to override this if you don't want to rely on the default, which is
        ``os.path.join(settings.BUILD_DIR, obj.get_absolute_url(), 'index.html')``.

    .. method:: get_build_path(obj)

        Used to determine where to build the detail page. Override this if you
        would like your detail page at a different location. By default it
        will be built at ``os.path.join(obj.get_url(), "index.html"``.

    .. method:: get_html(obj)

        How to render the output for the provided object's page. If you choose to render
        using something other than a Django template, like HttpResponse for
        instance, you will want to override this. By default it uses the template
        object's default ``render`` method.

    .. _get_url
    .. method:: get_url(obj)

        Returns the build directory, and therefore the URL, where the provided
        object's flat file should be placed. By default it is ``obj.get_absolute_url()``,
        so simplify defining that on your model is enough.

    .. py:attribute:: build_method

        An alias to the ``build_queryset`` method used by the :doc:`management commands </managementcommands>`

    .. py:method:: build_object(obj)

        Writes the rendered HTML for the template and the provided object to the build directory.

    .. py:method:: build_queryset()

        Writes the rendered template's HTML for each object in the ``queryset`` or ``model`` to a flat file. Only override this if you know what you're doing.

    .. py:method:: unbuild_object(obj)

        Deletes the directory where the provided object's flat files are stored.

    **Example myapp/models.py**

    .. code-block:: python

        from django.db im­port mod­els
        from bakery.mod­els im­port Build­ableMod­el


        class My­Mod­el(Build­ableMod­el):
            de­tail_views = ('myapp.views.ExampleDetailView',)
            title = mod­els.Char­Field(max_length=100)
            slug = models.SlugField(max_length=100)

            def get_absolute_url(self):
                """
                If you are going to publish a detail view for each object,
                one easy way to set the path where it will be built is to
                configure Django's standard get_absolute_url method.
                """
                return '/%s/' % self.slug

    **Example myapp/views.py**

    .. code-block:: python

        from myapp.models import MyModel
        from bakery.views import BuildableDetailView


        class ExampleDetailView(BuildableDetailView):
            queryset = MyModel.objects.filter(is_published=True)
            template_name = 'mymodel_detail.html'


BuildableArchiveIndexView
-------------------------

.. class:: BuildableArchiveIndexView(ArchiveIndexView, BuildableMixin)

    Renders and builds a top-level index page showing the “latest” objects,
    by date. Extended from Django's generic `ArchiveIndexView <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/class-based-views/generic-date-based/#archiveindexview>`_.
    The base class has a number of options not documented here you should consult.

    .. attribute:: model

        A Django database model where the list of objects can be drawn
        with a ``Model.objects.all()`` query. Optional. If you want to provide
        a more specific list, define the ``queryset`` attribute instead.

    .. attribute:: queryset

        The list of objects that will be provided to the template. Can be
        any iterable of items, not just a Django queryset. Optional, but
        if this attribute is not defined the ``model`` attribute must be
        defined.

    .. attribute:: build_path

        The target location of the flat file in the ``BUILD_DIR``.
        Optional. The default is ``archive/index.html``,  would place the flat file
        at the '/archive/' URL.

    .. attribute:: template_name

        The template you would like Django to render. You need
        to override this if you don't want to rely on the Django default,
        which is ``<model_name_lowercase>_archive.html``.

    .. py:attribute:: build_method

        An alias to the ``build_queryset`` method used by the :doc:`management commands </managementcommands>`
